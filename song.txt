Hey baby, won't you look my way?
I can be your new addiction
Hey baby, what you gotta say?
All you're giving me is fiction
I'm a sorry sucker and this happens all the time
I found out that everybody talks
Everybody talks, everybody talks

It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I could hear the chit chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always gotta back track
When everybody talks back

Hey honey, you could be my drug
You could be my new prescription
Too much could be an overdose
All this trash talk make me itchin'
Oh my, my shit
Everybody talks, everybody talks
Everybody talks, too much
